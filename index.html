  <h1> <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/31/">The Gopīs’ Songs of Separation</a></h1>
  <p><em> <strong>from Srimad Bhagavatam 10.31 </strong></em> </p>
  <p>This chapter relates how the gopīs, overwhelmed by feelings of separation from Kṛṣṇa, sat down on the bank of the Yamunā and began praying for His audience and singing His glories.

Because the gopīs had dedicated their minds and very lives to Kṛṣṇa, they were beside themselves with the transcendental pain of separation. But their crying, which appears like evidence of misery, actually shows their exalted state of transcendental bliss. As it is said, yata dekha vaiṣṇaver vyavahāra duḥkha/ niścaya jāniha sei paramānanda sukha: “Whenever one sees a Vaiṣṇava acting unhappy, one should know it for sure that he is actually experiencing the highest spiritual bliss.” Thus each of the gopīs began addressing Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa according to her individual mode of ecstasy, and they all prayed for Him for His mercy.</p>

  <li>O Lord, </li>
  <li>O lover,</li>
  <li>O cheater,</li>
  <li> when we remember Your smile, </li>
  <li>Your loving glances and Your pastimes with Your boyhood friends,</li>
  <li>we become extremely agitated. </li>
  <li>Remembering Your lotus face, </li>
  <li>adorned with locks of blackish hair smeared with the dust of the cows,</li>
  <li> we become irrevocably attached to You. </li>
  <li>And when we remember how You followed the cows from forest to forest with Your tender feet, we feel great pain.</li>
